# Fun Projects

### PvPanic
PvPanic is a peer-to-peer multiplayer shooter. The goal of the project is to learn the [Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org/) by creating a complete game using the engine so I can create a larger scale game I have been hoping to create for sometime.

### Asteroids-MonoGame
This is an incomplete recreation of the arcade game Asteroids. The goal of the project was to learn how to create a simple game in MonoGame, however I decided to switch to using Godot Engine before completing the project.

# School Projects

### Music Sync
Sync music files from a source to a destination and specify encoders for specific file types. The program is written in Rust, the language I choose to use for my final project in my Programming Languages course at Calvin College (CS-214).

### Space Game
Created for my "passion project" assignment in my Senior English class during high school. I had always wanted to create a game in space so I choose to work towards that for the assignment. After the class, I decided I wanted to create my games in something open source and stopped working on the project.

### Hamlet Game
A video game version of a portion of Hamlet created for my Senior English class in high school. The game was created in Game Maker Studio. This is one of the first games I ever created, and as a result it certainly has some issues but is still playable. Use the arrow keys to move.

### Moby Dick Game
For my American Literature class in high school, I created a arcade style game where you play as Captain Ahab and attempt to hit Moby Dick with as many harpoons as possible before he inevitably kills you. The game was created using Game Maker Studio. Unfortunately, I no longer have the source code for the game, and don't have a working executable.
