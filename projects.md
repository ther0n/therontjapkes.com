# Fun Projects

### PvPanic
PvPanic is a peer-to-peer multiplayer shooter. The goal of the project is to learn the [Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org/) by creating a complete game using the engine. I plan to use what I learn from this project to create a game I have been wanting to make for some time.

### Asteroids-MonoGame
This is an incomplete recreation of the classic game Asteroids. The goal of the project was to learn how to create a simple game in MonoGame, however I decided to switch to using Godot Engine.

# School Projects

### Music Sync
Sync music files from a source to a destination and specify encoders for specific file types. The program is written in Rust the language I choose to use for my final project in my Programming Languages course at Calvin College (CS-214).

### Space Game
This was my "passion project" for my Senior English class in high school. Our assignment was to work on a passion and write about what we learned through the process and present the result to the class. I have always wanted to create a game in space, and I decided to pursue that goal for my project. The project is in Game Maker Studio, after the class I stopped working on the project as I wanted to create the game using something open source, which is how I went to MonoGame and now to Godot Engine.

### Hamlet Game
A video game version of a portion of Hamlet created for my Senior English class in high school. The game was created in Game Maker Studio. The game is somewhat buggy, however it is playable. Use the arrow keys to move.

### Moby Dick Game
For my American Literature class in high school, I created a arcade style game where you play as Captain Ahab and attempt to hit Moby Dick with as many harpoons as possible before he inevitably kills you. The game was created using Game Maker Studio. Unfortunately, I no longer have the source code for the game, and don't have a working executable.
