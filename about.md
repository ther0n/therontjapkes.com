I am currently studying Computer Science at ~~Calvin College~~ Calvin University. I have interests in just about anything computers but specifically Linux, FOSS, and game development. I'm also interested in weather, and just about anything else that involves understanding the world. I hope to one day write and publish a game, currently I'm learning how to draw and create music to create original assets for such a game.

## Contact me

The best way to contact me is by email or through Discord. I have social media accounts but I rarely check them.
