I am a computer science student at Calvin College. I have interests in software development (espescially if that software is a game), and information security.

In my free time I enjoy learning about new things whether it's a programming language, software, hardware, or other topics and skills related and unrelated to technology. I also enjoy playing and creating video games, I'm currently working on a game I hope to publish once finished. Feel free to contact me using one of the methods below.
