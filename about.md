I am a computer science student at Calvin College. I have interests in software development (espescially if that software is a game), and information security.

In my free time, I enjoy both playing and making video games. I enjoy working with computer hardware, and have built my own desktop computer which I use for both development and gaming. I also enjoy modifying my devices to do things they often weren't meant to do, for example running doom on an MP3 player. This lead to my interest in information security as most modifications rely on exploits in the device and it's software.
