My American Literature class provided a lot of freedom for the final project. With this freedom I created a video game representation of Rip Van Winkle with a twist. Rather than taking place in America it takes place in the future at a Mar's colony. The people of Mar's wish for independence from Earth. Rip is abducted by an alien who challenges him to a Tic Tac Toe match. During the epic face off between the alien Tic Tac Toe master and Rip, the alien ship passes a blackhole causing time for Rip to pass much more slowly relative to time back on Mars. After defeating the alien in Tic Tac Toe, Rip is brought back to Mar's where he finds that years have passed despite only being gone for hours at most from his perspective...

If the game doesn't work or you want to see a playthrough:
